                        Cutting edge software is often key to the success of any
                        organizations and can help optimize several tasks. Our
                        developers and consultants will study your operations
                        and find out the bottlenecks that can be resolved by
                        some sort of automation. We will then work with you to
                        create a custom-built software system that will
                        significantly improve your operations effectively and

              We will work with your organization to understand the project in
              great depth and scope out the minimum viable product (MVP). Once
              we agree on the MVP, the project lead will write up a statement of
              work to be shared with the nonprofit.

            </h5>
            <p>
              After the statement of work passes, our developers work in teams
              and start building the minimum viable product (MVP) and share
              their progress with the clients regularly for feedback. Once, the
              MVP is ready, it is shared with the clients for a thorough
              inspection and review following which it enters user testing.

            <h3>Phase 3</h3>
            <h5 className="dark-text">User Testing</h5>

              Once the MVP is ready, we add various analytics plugins and survey
              tools and then distribute the MVP among a wide array of audiences
              for testing. In the meanwhile, the developers continue building
              additional functionality and also resolve bugs as they arise.

            <p>
              At the end of the user testing phase, the team makes their final
              tweaks and fixes any issues that may arise during user testing.
              They then hand-off the project to the clients and if needed help
              them configure it.
